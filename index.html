<p>Do you love nothing more than a post-screening roundtable with friends to debate what you’ve just seen?<br> Are you the person in that group who picks their corner – It was terrible! I freaking loved it! – and stays there, immovable, batting away all contrary arguments with your own skillful and well thought-out counterpoints? (Or by, you know, just shouting them down?) Then chances are you’ve participated, full-throated, in one of what we’re dubbing 10 of the most divisive movie and TV debates of the last two decades.<br>

These aren’t your regular “liked it or didn’t like it” kinda chats – these are the kind of bare-knuckled, no-holds-barred, defend-till-you’re-sweating – but always civilly! – pop-culture bouts that have made headlines, ended friendships, and in some cases, still rage on today. Marvel vs.<br> DC? No end in sight for that particular infinite war. The virtues of Avatar? It’s round 2 come the sequels. Team Edward vs. Team Jacob? We’re still wearing the scars, if not our R-Patz tees.<br>

Folks at Comic-Con: San Diego will get the chance to debate critics and some special celebrity guests on some of the biggest entertainment hot topics of today at Rotten Tomatoes’ own live event, Your Opinion Sucks, which happens over three days from July 19-21. And you can watch it all unfold on video at our Comic-Con Ketchup page.<br> In the meantime, though, to get you in the mood – and your mind sharpened for battle – we’re breaking down some of the most heart-stirring and temperature-raising movie and TV debates in recent memory.<hr></p>
<h2>OLD STAR WARS VS NEW STAR WARS</h2>

<p>So divisive, and sometimes toxic, has some of the discourse around Star Wars become, that we hesitate to even go there. But, if we’re considering the biggest debates of the last two decades, it’s hard to ignore the galactic-sized debate over the new trilogy.<br> On the one hand, critics and most fans have roundly welcomed the new entries into the central Star Wars saga, with its gutsy heroine (Rey, played by Daisy Ridley) and, especially in The Last Jedi, bold new story directions.<br> On the other hand, some fans have called out Lucasfilm, Disney, and the filmmakers for moving away from the spirit of the original series, ladling on too much discordant humor, and for…well, those bold new story directions.<br> (And then there’s the question of spinoffs.) As for other criticisms you might see, those driven by misogyny and racism, there’s no debate:<br> there’s no place for that in galaxies far, far away, close to home, or otherwise.<hr></p>

<h3>AVATAR: GAME-CHANGING CLASSIC OR OVERRATED VIDEO GAME?</h3>

<p>It’s amazing that a decade has already passed since Avatar became the highest-grossing movie ever, considering how long James Cameron talked about planet Pandora and how much hype was generated leading up to the movie’s theatrical release.<br> And when the movie came out, audience reaction could be split along one distinct line:<br> Admirers found it a dazzling, eye-popping action sci-fi/fantasy, with a sweet touch of romance and mysticism; haters dismissed Avatar with a pithy eye-roll and simple catchphrase:<br> “Pocahontas in space!” (Or FernGully, depending on how deep you like your cuts.)<br> The battle is set to pick up again in 2020, when Cameron releases the first of three planned sequels.<hr></p>
<h4>THE SIMPSONS VS. FAMILY GUY</h4>
<img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.smnzEJbrxl3UdC7_yC9oLQHaEK&pid=Api&P=0">
<p>When The Simpsons debuted in 1989, with its adult humor and everyman family, it defined primetime animated entertainment for a generation. <br>Family Guy followed almost exactly a decade later on the same network, Fox, with a similar blue-humor, blue-collar-family setup.<br> But how do Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie hold up against Peter, Lois, Chris, Meg, diabolical baby Stewie, and sophisticated talking dog Brian? Ask around – people have their (very strong) opinions on the long-running shows: The Simpsons is going on its 30th season this fall;<br> Family Guy, which was once cancelled by the network then revived after a strong showing on Cartoon Network and in DVD sales, will debut its 17th season.<br> For some, The Simpsons‘ has never been as good as it was back in the day; for others, Family Guy is too one-note and mean-spirited.<br> As much as we’d love to settle this animated beef with Tomatometer scores,<br> Family Guy doesn’t have quite enough reviews to meet the criteria for a series score<br> (at least half of a show’s seasons must have a score for it to get a series score) —<br> but perhaps that fact alone decides this contest of colorful characters.<hr></p>
<h5>LA LA LAND REINVENTED THE MUSICAL VS. LA LA LAND IS A PROBLEMATIC BORE</h5>
<img src="https://prd-rteditorial.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/13134924/La-La-Land.jpg">
<p>Depending on who you ask, La La Land is a modern musical masterpiece, with pitch-perfect casting, precise choreography,<br> and innovative direction that was tragically robbed of Best Picture – or it is a shameless example of Hollywood self-congratulation chock full of bubblegum pop and mediocre singing and dancing.<br> The 2017 Oscar ceremony will always be remembered for the envelope mix-up when Land was erroneously declared Best Picture over rightful Moonlight, but we won’t soon forget the intense backlash that then Oscar frontrunner  La La Land faced towards the end of awards season. The film was technical and precise,<br> Damien Chazelle’s skill behind the camera is undeniable, and critics and most of the audience found it all terribly swoon-worthy.<br> However, many viewers and cultural commentators noted that a narrative that casts Ryan Gosling as the one and only hope to save jazz from John Legend (!) was ever going to pass the smell test.<br> And then there were the musical purists who took issue with Emma Stone’s voice and Gosling’s dance form. Whose side were you dancing on?<hr></p>
